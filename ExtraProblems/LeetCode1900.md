# üî• Efficient DFS with Symmetry Optimization

---

## üí° Intuition

The problem asks for the **earliest and latest round** in which two specific players can meet in a knockout tournament.

In a knockout format:

- Players are paired from the ends inward: 1 vs n, 2 vs n-1, and so on.
- Winners move to the next round, and pairings are formed again in the same manner.

My first thought was to use **DFS** to simulate all valid player progressions and track the rounds in which the two specified players meet. Symmetry in matchups can be used to reduce redundant states.

## üß≠ Approach ‚Äî *DFS with Symmetry Optimization*

1. **Recursive Simulation (DFS):**  
   Use a recursive function `dfs(n, p1, p2)` to simulate rounds, calculate the next matchups, and track when the two players meet.

2. **Base Case:**  
   If `p1 + p2 == n + 1`, they are facing each other this round. Return `{1, 1}`.

3. **Symmetry Reduction:**  
   Mirror positions of the players if they lie closer to the end, which helps avoid recalculating symmetric states.

4. **Recursive Exploration:**
   - **Case A**: Players both in the first half. Explore all combinations of who they could‚Äôve been in the previous round.
   - **Case B**: Players are on opposite ends. Use mirrored logic and offset calculations to trace valid previous-round positions.

5. **Track Rounds:**  
   Collect the earliest and latest rounds when the two players can meet across all explored paths.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity

- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(n^4)$$  
  Due to recursive branching with nested loops for combinations of positions. Optimization via symmetry reduces some calls.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(n)$$  
  For the recursion stack. Can be improved further with memoization (not included here).
